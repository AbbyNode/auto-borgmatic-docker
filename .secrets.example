# Borgmatic backup encryption passphrase
# IMPORTANT: Change this to a strong, unique passphrase before starting the container
# This passphrase is required to encrypt and decrypt your backups
# Keep this passphrase safe - you will need it to restore backups

# For local use (same machine backups):
BORG_PASSPHRASE=change-me-to-a-secure-passphrase

# For remote repository use, you can also set:
# BORG_REPO=ssh://user@backup-server.com/path/to/repo
# And mount your SSH key at /root/.ssh/id_rsa in docker-compose.yml
